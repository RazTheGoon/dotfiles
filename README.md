# Dotfiles

Here are where my configs for various linux customizations/rice are hosted. I do this to share what I am doing with linux customization, but also to allow some form of persistance if I ever screw something up. Anyone is welcome to use these as a starting point. Hell, If you do something cool, send your config back to me. Inspiration is always welcome.
